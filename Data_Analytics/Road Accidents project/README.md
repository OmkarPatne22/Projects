# Road Accident Analysis ðŸš§

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents a detailed *Road Accident Analysis* using *Power BI*. The goal is to visualize and analyze patterns in road accident data to understand the key causes and affected areas. With the help of interactive dashboards, this project provides insights that can aid in improving road safety and decision-making by authorities.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset includes the following information:
- Date and time of accidents  
- Accident locations (State/City)
- Vehicle types involved  
- Weather and road conditions  
- Number of injuries and fatalities  
- Type and severity of accidents

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

- Identify high-risk accident zones
- Analyze time-based accident trends (yearly, monthly, hourly)
- Find common causes of accidents
- Determine vehicle categories with higher accident involvement
- Recommend improvements to reduce accidents

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Highlights

Using Power BI, the following dashboards and visualizations were created:

- *Heatmap of Accident-Prone Locations*
- *Bar Charts for Major Causes*
- *Pie Charts showing Vehicle Type Contribution*
- *Line Graphs for Yearly & Monthly Trends*
- *Filterable Reports by State, Vehicle Type, and Severity*

## âš™ Tools Used

- *Microsoft Power BI* â€“ for data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation  
- *Excel* â€“ for initial data handling (if used)  
- *Git & GitHub* â€“ for project version control and hosting

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This dashboard allows users to interactively explore accident data and draw actionable insights. It can help traffic departments, researchers, and policymakers make informed decisions to improve public safety.
